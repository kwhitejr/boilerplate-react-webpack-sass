# boilerplate-react-webpack-sass
Basic setup for building with ReactJS, Webpack, and Sass

###Set-up  
Run `npm install` to load packages.

###Development Environment
Run `npm run dev` to put Webpack in watch mode.  
Run `live-server src/client` to see your work.

###Production Build
Run `npm run build` to put Webpack in production mode, which minimizes the bundle file automatically.
